Selection of health-related data.  **This is only some of the available data.**   Additional resources can be found on the [wiki for this event](https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/health-hack-weekend/wiki).  You can also add data requests to the [data request page of the wiki](https://github.com/OpenDataSTL/health-hack-weekend/wiki/Data-Requests) and we'll do our best to help you find the information you need! 

Notes:

**food-establishments.csv** is a complete export of active permitted food facilities. **food-establishments-rough-geocode.json** was a quick, first pass geocode that caught 91% of addresses.  Depending on your project, both files may be useful. 

**food-inspections.csv** is a complementary dataset of establishment inspections.
